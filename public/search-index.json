    "content": "Over the past few years, FIF has created a platform to facilitate critical conversations on youth, education, and digital financial inclusion to name a few. This year, FIF 2025 will explore the theme of Climate Adaptation in Agriculture, Food Security, and Livelihoods. With global priorities constantly evolving, conversations on critical issues face the threat of being sidelined. As such, this 2-day residential conference will provide a platform for development practitioners, climate practitioners, entrepreneurs and the larger development ecosystem partners to openly discuss emerging climate challenges and climate adaptation solutions grounded in the realities of the Global South.The event will feature immersive field visits to climate-vulnerable regions in Bangladesh, dynamic panel discussions, interactive breakout sessions, impact talks, and a dedicated space for practitioners to showcase innovative, climate-adaptive initiatives."
